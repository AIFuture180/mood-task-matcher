                    <p>Feeling down or stuck in a rut? You don’t need hours to turn your mood around—sometimes, a quick activity can make all the difference. These five science-backed mood boosters are simple, effective, and can be done anywhere, whether you’re at work, home, or on the go.</p>
                    <h5>5 Steps to Boost Your Mood Instantly</h5>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Take 5 Deep Breaths:</strong> Deep breathing calms your nervous system and reduces stress. Inhale for 4 seconds, hold for 4, and exhale for 4. Repeat five times and feel the tension melt away.</li>
                        <li><strong>Play a Favorite Song:</strong> Music can instantly lift your spirits. Pick an upbeat song you love, play it for 2 minutes, and let yourself dance or hum along.</li>
                        <li><strong>Write a Gratitude Note:</strong> Jot down one thing you’re grateful for on a sticky note or your phone. It could be as simple as “I’m thankful for my cozy sweater.” This shifts your focus to the positive.</li>
                        <li><strong>Stretch for 1 Minute:</strong> Stand up and stretch your arms to the sky, then touch your toes. This quick movement boosts blood flow and releases feel-good endorphins.</li>
                        <li><strong>Smile at Yourself:</strong> Look in a mirror (or imagine one) and smile for 10 seconds. Smiling triggers the release of dopamine, even if you’re faking it at first!</li>

                        <li>For 60 seconds, stare at it and breathe slowly.</li>
                        <li>Imagine it filling you with calm or energy.</li>
