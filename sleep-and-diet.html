        <h2>Transform Your Diet with Gary Brecka’s Model</h2>
        <p>At Mood-to-Task Matcher, we believe in science-backed approaches to improve your well-being. That’s why we’ve adopted Gary Brecka’s diet model from The Ultimate Human to guide our dietary recommendations. Brecka, a renowned human biologist and biohacker, focuses on a high-fat, low-carb, moderate-protein ketogenic diet to optimize health, energy, and longevity.</p>
        <h3>Key Principles of the Gary Brecka Diet</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Macronutrient Ratios:</strong> Aim for 70-75% fat, 20-25% protein, and 5-10% carbohydrates to enter ketosis, where your body burns fat for energy instead of glucose.</li>
            <li><strong>The 30-30-30 Method:</strong> Start your day with 30 grams of protein within 30 minutes of waking, followed by 30 minutes of low-intensity exercise (e.g., walking or light jogging, keeping your heart rate below 135 beats per minute). This helps stabilize blood sugar, reduce cravings, and promote fat burning.</li>
            <li><strong>Focus on Whole Foods:</strong> Choose nutrient-dense, unprocessed foods to fuel your body and reduce inflammation.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Recommended Foods</h3>
        <p>Incorporate these foods into your diet to align with Brecka’s model:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Proteins:</strong> Grass-fed ribeye steak, grass-fed ground beef, wild-caught salmon, pasture-raised eggs.</li>
            <li><strong>Carbs:</strong> Organic rice, avocados, asparagus, Brussels sprouts, broccoli, arugula, berries (blueberries, raspberries, blackberries, strawberries).</li>
            <li><strong>Fats:</strong> Organic coconut milk, coconut oil, ghee, grass-fed butter, tallow, olive oil, avocado oil.</li>
            <li><strong>Seasonings:</strong> Celtic sea salt.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Foods to Avoid</h3>
        <p>Steer clear of these to support your health goals:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Refined sugars and processed fats.</li>
            <li>GMOs and tap water (opt for hydrogen water instead).</li>
            <li>Whey protein supplements (choose vegan, soy-free, vegetable-based protein if needed).</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Benefits of the Gary Brecka Diet</h3>
        <p>Adopting this diet can lead to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Improved metabolic health and sustained energy.</li>
            <li>Natural weight management without extreme dieting.</li>
            <li>Enhanced mental clarity and mood stability.</li>
            <li>Reduced inflammation for overall well-being.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Additional Tips</h3>
        <p>Stay hydrated with hydrogen water, as recommended by Brecka, to support digestion and reduce inflammation. Consider personalized supplements (e.g., Vitamin D3) based on bloodwork, and consult a healthcare professional before making significant dietary changes.</p>
