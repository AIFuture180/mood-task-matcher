        <h2>Start Your Day with Positivity</h2>
        <p>How you begin your morning can set the tone for your entire day. A thoughtful morning routine can boost your mood, increase your energy, and help you feel more in control. Here’s how to create a morning routine that leaves you feeling uplifted and ready to tackle the day.</p>
        <h3>5 Steps to a Mood-Boosting Morning Routine</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Wake Up with Gratitude:</strong> Before getting out of bed, think of three things you’re grateful for. This simple practice can shift your mindset to a positive start.</li>
            <li><strong>Hydrate First Thing:</strong> Drink a glass of water to rehydrate your body after sleep. Add a slice of lemon for a refreshing twist.</li>
            <li><strong>Move Your Body:</strong> Spend 5 minutes stretching or doing light exercise, like a quick walk or yoga. Movement boosts endorphins and energizes you.</li>
            <li><strong>Plan Your Day with Intention:</strong> Write down one goal or positive intention for the day, such as “I’ll smile at a stranger today.” This gives you purpose.</li>
            <li><strong>Enjoy a Mindful Moment:</strong> Take 2 minutes to sip your coffee or tea mindfully, savoring the warmth and flavor, to ground yourself before the day begins.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Kickstart Your Day with Joy</h3>
        <p>A morning routine doesn’t have to be complicated to be effective. Start with these steps, adjust them to fit your lifestyle, and watch how they transform your mood each day!</p>
